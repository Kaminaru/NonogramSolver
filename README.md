# Nonogram Solver in Java

Plans for future versions:
* [x] Solves Nonogram 
* [X] User input
* [X] User able to solve nonogram and check if solution is right
* [X] GUI (JavaFX)
* [X] Read from txt file
* [ ] Threads (update board while finding solution (needed for 15x15 or more))
* [ ] Implement openCV that will read nonogram numbers from video/photo, so I don't need to write numbers myself.




# Current result:
User able to change size of the board:

Import numbers from the file, and solve it by yourself or by pressing "Solve":

User can reset board and also try to solve nonogram himself and check if his solution is right (both before and after importing from the file):
