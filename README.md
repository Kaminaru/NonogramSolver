# Nonogram Solver in Java

Plans for future versions:
* [x] Solves Nonogram 
* [X] User input
* [ ] User able to solve nonogram and check if solution is right
* [X] GUI
* [ ] Read from txt file
* [ ] Threads (showing board while finding solution)
* [ ] Implement openCV that will read nonogram numbers from video/photo, so I don't need to write numbers myself.
